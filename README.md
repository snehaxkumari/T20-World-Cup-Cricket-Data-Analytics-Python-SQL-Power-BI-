# T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics (Python, SQL, Power BI) 
In this project, we analyzed data from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2022 to derive meaningful insights and build an optimal “Best XI” team. Data was scraped from the ESPN Cricinfo website using Bright Data web scraping tools, ensuring up-to-date and comprehensive player statistics. The analysis was conducted using Python and Pandas for data cleaning and transformation, followed by Power BI for interactive data visualization and dashboard creation. This project highlights the use of data-driven decision-making in sports analytics by identifying top-performing players across various performance metrics such as runs, wickets, strike rates, and economy rates.
